CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2022.2.4/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.23/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SDL2main)
  does not match the name of the calling package (SDL2).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
